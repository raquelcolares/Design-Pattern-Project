# Design Patterns Project

---------------------------------------------------------------

This project was designed to load, process, analyze multiple types of data
from a single CSV file, and create a classification Neural Network Model, utilizing different classes and different design patterns.

**Project Phase 1:**
Create a logging system where the log output can be easily redirected to specific output formats (console, file, etc.) and ensure that the logging configuration and handling are managed via a single instance (singleton).

**Project Phase 2:**
Extend the system where the output of the logger can be adapted to various formats (like console output, file output, or even a hypothetical network output).



### Libraries required for this project:

*   Pandas
*   Numpy
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn
*   Sklearn
*   Streamlit
*   Pickle
*   Logging
*   Unittest
