# Design Patterns Project

---------------------------------------------------------------

This project was designed to load, process, analyze multiple types of data
from a single CSV file, and create a classification Neural Network Model, utilizing different classes and different design patterns.

**Project Phase 1:**

Create a logging system where the log output can be easily redirected to specific output formats (console, file, etc.) and ensure that the logging configuration and handling are managed via a single instance (singleton).

**Project Phase 2:**

Extend the system where the output of the logger can be adapted to various formats (like console output, file output, or even a hypothetical network output).

**Project Phase 3:**

Extend the logging system to notify subscribed observers whenever a logging event occurs. This will allow multiple parts of the application to react to logs dynamically.
